# NN-with-Tensorflow

In this project; I used 2 files. my_answers.py to develop my neural network. the model overestimates bike ridership in December 
because it hasn't had sufficient holiday season training examples. The predictions generally are quite accurate, though!

To make changes on this project use my_answers.py file

All the code in the notebook runs in Python 3 all unit tests have to be marked as passed.

The training loss has to be below 0.09 and the validation loss need to below 0.18.
